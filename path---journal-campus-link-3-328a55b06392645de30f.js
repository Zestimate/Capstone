Still don't, but I found it was a good time to socialize with friends somewhere on campus. I hadn't had any other club experiences otherwise. I knew a lot of people from this club to begin with because I have a network of friends in CS who are a part of it, so it wasn't about meeting people per se, especially with the number of introverts, but more about learning how a club operates. This club rarely meets, so there's not much room for opportunity in getting together, but when they do, it's a free pizza party which I was especially down for. Free food and hanging out with friends is always great in my books.</p>",excerpt:"I knew of this club since last year, but never bothered to check it out until this year because I wasn't really feeling for joining clubs…",timeToRead:1,fields:{date:"October 27, 2018",slug:"/journal/campus-link-3/"},frontmatter:{title:"Campus Link: Campus Club, Linux User Group"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/journal/campus-link-3/"}}}});
