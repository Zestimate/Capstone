title: "Campus Link: Campus Club, Linux User Group"

I knew of this club since last year, but never bothered to check it out until this year because I wasn't really feeling for joining clubs then. Still don't, but I found dropping in to be a good time socializing with friends somewhere on campus. I hadn't had any other club experiences otherwise. I knew a lot of people from this club to begin with because I have a network of friends in CS (Computer Science) who are a part of it, so it wasn't about meeting people per se (especially with the number of introverts there), but more about learning how a club operates and even what to expect. This club rarely meets, so there's not much opportunity in getting together, but when they do, it's typically a free pizza party which I was especially down for. Free food and hanging out with friends is always great in my books. It was nice to partake in this on campus within a very niche club.
